üöÄ Introduction
=================

Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems **guidelines on how to tackle certain problems**. They are not classes, packages or libraries that you can plug into your application and wait for the magic to happen. These are, rather, guidelines on how to tackle certain problems in certain situations.

Wikipedia describes them as

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

‚ö†Ô∏è Be Careful
-----------------
- Design patterns are not a silver bullet to all your problems.
- Do not try to force them bad things are supposed to happen, if done so. Keep in mind that design patterns are solutions **to** problems, not solutions **finding** problems so don't overthink.
- If used in a correct place in a correct manner, they can prove to be a savior or else they can result in a horrible mess of a code.




## üê¢ Before you start

- All design patterns have been implemented in [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features), the new version of javascript.
- Since javascript does not have any implementation of interfaces, the examples here use implied interfaces, which means that as long as a class has attributes and methods that a particular interface is supposed to have, it is considered to implement that interface. To make it easier to tell the interface we are using, its information can be found in the comments of every example.
